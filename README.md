# ReqresAPI - Demo

In this app I wanted to demonstrate my skills in working with API and also in building UI in code. In this project I didn't use Storyboards for the core features (I used Storyboard for LaunchScreen). I presented data from ReqresAPI inside UITableView with custom UITableViewCells. I also added another screen - Detail Screen for every cell in table.

<br>

### Assumptions:
1. Present data from API inside UITableView.
2. Create detail screen. 
3. No 3rd party libraries.
4. 100% programatic UI.
<br>

### How to install
1. Clone this repo to Xcode.
2. Choose the Simulator.
3. Hit Run button.
